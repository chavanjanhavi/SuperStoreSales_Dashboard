# SuperStore_Sales_Dashboard In Power BI

This project focused on designing an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze Superstore sales data and uncover key business insights. The objective was to provide a comprehensive understanding of sales performance, customer preferences, and profitability trends.
The analysis included identifying states with the highest sales and profit, determining the total profit, and recognizing products with the highest demand. The project also explored the sales and profit contributions of various categories and subcategories, along with understanding customer preferences for payment modes. Additionally, it compared sales and profit data across the same months of different years to reveal growth trends and areas for improvement.

**Data Preparation :**
Identified and Removed null values, duplicates, and corrupted entries for a clean dataset.
Used find and replace to correct inconsistent or erroneous values.
Prepared data for analysis by ensuring accuracy and consistency.

**Dashboard Features :**
Designed visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, donut charts, maps, slicers, and tables for clear representation.
Created KPIs to calculate metrics like total and average sales, profit, and order fulfillment time.
Used maps to display sales and profit by state for geographic insights.

**Key Business Insights :**  
- Overall Metrics: Assessed total sales, profit, and quantities sold to gauge overall business performance.<br>
- Category and Subcategory Analysis: Analyzed total sales and profit across categories and subcategories to identify high-performing areas.  
- Regional Insights: Analyzed regions with the highest sales and profit.  
- Product Performance: Identified best-selling products to inform inventory and marketing strategies.  
- Payment Mode Insights: Investigated sales distribution by various payment methods.  
- Yearly Comparisons: Analyzed sales and profit fluctuations over the past two years to assess business growth using area(line chart)  
- Geographic Insights: Mapped sales and profit contributions by state to highlight regional performance using map visual  
- Region-Based Filtering: Used slicers for region-specific filtering of data.  
- City-Level Analysis: Identified the city with the highest sales and profit to pinpoint key markets.  
- Sales and Profit by Date: Analyzed daily sales and profit, along with the quantity sold on each date, to track performance fluctuations.
